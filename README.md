# Project 17: Penny Pitch

Complete project 12-13 in your textbook on pages 480 and 481, with the following modifications.
```
1. Make the project using two classes.
2. The server class must have at least 4 methods.
3. Create a scorboard that keeps score. Where the penny lands is the points you earn. If the penny lands on the same location, that score does not count again.
```
**Hint:**
```
You will either need a parallel array for score or learn how to parse strings to integers for the score.
